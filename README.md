# Convert to WebP

Convert image files in formats like `.png`, and `.jpg` to web-optimized
`.webp` format by right-clicking on the files in MacOS Finder and selecting
**Quick Actions** -> **Convert to WebP**.

Dependencies:

- [webp](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/webp). Install with `brew install webp` using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).
The workflow assumes that the `cwebp` binary is in `/opt/homebrew/bin/cwebp` location.

**Dev note**: I wrote this extension with the help of Claude 3.5 Sonnet,
