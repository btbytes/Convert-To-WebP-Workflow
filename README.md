# Convert to WebP

Convert image files in formats like `.png`, and `.jpg` to web-optimized
`.webp` format by right-clicking on the files in MacOS Finder and selecting
**Quick Actions** -> **Convert to WebP**.

Dependencies:

- [webp](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/webp). Install with `brew install webp` using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).
The workflow assumes that the `cwebp` binary is in `/opt/homebrew/bin/cwebp` location. ALso, the default output quality is seto `80` (which I think is fair).


## Installation

1. Download the ZIP archive of this repo  from the **Code** dropdown on github.
1. Unzip the file.
1. Rename the folder `Convert-To-WebP-Workflow-main` to `Convert-To-WebP.webflow`. The icon will change to "..." circumscribed by a circle.
1. Double click on the icon to install.
